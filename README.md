## Mapping Earthquakes Challenge

## Overview
This project is about creating a web application that uses the Leafly javascript library and geoJSON files from a website to depict several maps on earthquake data.

This map allows 3 different ways to filter out all earthquakes, major earthquakes with a magnitiude greater than 5, and the tectonic plates across the world.

## Results
We can observe from the filters that many major earthquakes with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater occur along 2 locations:

- The western coastline of South-America where there are 2 tectonic plates directly below the coatline (the Nazca and South America plates)

- Any South-Asian or East-Asian country sitting near the Sunda or Okhotsk tectonic plate region such as the Phillipines, Indonesia, and Japan.

- The Pacific tectonic plate is what seperates the Nazca and other tectonic plates along East-Asia.
